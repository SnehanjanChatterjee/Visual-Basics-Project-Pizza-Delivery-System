# Visual-Basics-Project-Pizza-Delivery-System
I made an application using Visual Basics 6.0 as a part of my college 4th semester project.The application comprises user registration,login and forgot password system,various pages to choose the pizza,add to cart system and checkout page,alongside a customer feedback page. I used MS Access as the Database for storing user credentials.
